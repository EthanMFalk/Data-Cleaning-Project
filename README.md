# Data-Cleaning-Project

This project involved cleaning Nashville Housing data using basic to advanced SQL queries. The dates were first standardized to show the correct date format. The property address data was then populated by joining two tables and removing all 'NULL' values in the property address column. The property address column was then put into individual columns such as the address, city, and state. Values containing 'Y' and 'N' in the 'Sold as Vacant' column were changed to 'Yes' and 'No' to efficiently display the total housing sales. Duplicate and unused columns were removed to improve clarity.
